# Training Day
For the fifth year, the Portland OWASP chapter is proud to host our information security training day! This will be an excellent opportunity for the local Portland security community to receive top quality information security and application security training for prices far lower than normally offered. This year's training day will be a fully virtual event which includes a morning keynote, two morning sessions, a lunch panel, two afternoon sessions, and an all-day CTF.

The 5th annual OWASP Portland 2021 Training Day date will be on October 13, 2021.
